# SpaceTimeClusteringDiseaseTrends

This repository contains R code for a Bayesian space-time model for clustering areal units based on their disease risk trends. This code is specifically for the Poisson variant of the model. An additional R file containing code on how to implement the model is also provided, with accompanying data relating to respiratory hospital admissions in the Greater Glasgow & Clyde region of Scotland between 2002 and 2011.
